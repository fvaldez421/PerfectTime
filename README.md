# PerfectTime
### Overview
Perfect Time is a fertility tracking app. It allows one to keep track of mood, energy level, basal body temperature and various other signs and symptoms. There is also a calendar view that will eventually be developed into a helpful, sharing,  tool that will facilitate communication of optimal periods during the fertility cycle for conception or conception avoidance. Perfect Time utilizes Google Passport and OAth, charts.js, body-parser, cookie-session, ejs, express, express-session, jquery, mysql, mysql2 and sequelize.
